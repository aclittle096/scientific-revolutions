                <p>
                    The mainstay theme of Kuhn's discussion of revolutions was that they were necessary for new discoveries
                    and theories in science. According to Kuhn, these new
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)#In_science"> discoveries</a> and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory"> theories</a> themselves require the
                    discovery of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalistics">anomalies</a></i>: the
                    unexpected findings of science.

                            different from those derived from its predecessor. That difference could not occur if the
                            two were logically compatible. In the process of being assimilated, the second must displace
                            the first.
